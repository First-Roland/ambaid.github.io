<h1>AGUREMENT AGAINST HOLDING A TIC AND BC</h1>
            <h3> 1.	INTODUCTION TO TIC or ATIC AND BC</h3>
<h4>TIC stand for TRANSITIONAL IDENTITY CARD</h4>
<h4>BC stands for BIRTH CERTIFICATE</h4>
           <p> TIC and BC is a revolutionary authorized document that permit free citizens of SOUTHERN CAMEROON today known as AMBAZONIA, it existence became into practice since August 7, 2019 and earn the support of patriotic Citizens, Rational thinkers, Revolutionary activist of good faith and party groups individually, willingly. </p>
<p> The department responsible for the promotion and development of TIC/BC are ACCD meaning AMBAZONIA CENTRAL CITIZENSHIP DEPARTMENT, this department works directly for the good and satisfaction of it citizen especially direct in GZ (Ground Zero), </p>
<p>Some measures and characteristic were put in place before choosing the icons found in the TIC as well as the BC. In general the photos do recall and remind us from where we started and where we are heading to.</p>
<p>We have the country map at the back part of the TIC which explain the territory we belong to</p>
<p>We have flag at the font top-left hand side of the TIC, the blue and which interpret the land of milk and honey as well as the free country full of hope, hardworking, love, development etc </p>
 <p>Talking about the logo of ACCD which assume the responsibility of making such progress, members are dynamic patriot of AMBAZONIA</p>
<p>AGovC logo (AMBAZONIA GOVERNMENT COUNCIL) the logo is presented both behind and front of the TIC and in front of BC</p>
 <p>Reason why identify AGovC as security department </p>
<p> 1.	They have proven and shown great progress on both security of IDPS ANS EDPS in GZ.</p>
 <p>2.	They contain the largest form of Defense Unite nearly all over GZ  </p>
 <p>3.	AGovC is able to unite and form Alliance with five and more Defense Unite, examples are SWARDS, TIGER, BRFC, etc it is a matter of time for AGovC to finally Unite forces on ground</p>
<p>4.	AGovC is capable of arm his large colony with modern weapons which is exactly what we are looking up for</p>
 <p>5.	AGovC is a council as not a government so it stands a good chance of exploiting his techniques to the benefit of Ambazonia, AGovC have proven that and his proving it</p>
 <p>6.	AGovC is focus and determine and that is what it takes to achieve freedom </p>
 <p>7.	With the above point AGovC then stand a chance of being represented as LEGAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT OR COUNCIL FOR AMBAZONIA (DR. Ayaba Cho Lucas) as icon carrier</p>
   <br><center> <img src="AGovC-1.jpg" style="width: 700px; height:300px;"></center>

 <p>IG logo (INTERIM GOVERNMENT) seen both faces of the TIC and in front of BC, </p>
 <p>Reason why IG is represented as legal AUTHORITY</p>
 <p>We can’t deny the fact that there exist 2 IG, the first one lead by I.P Sisyku  Ayuke Tabe  and the second by Ikome Sako, as AIP</p>
<p>1.	The logic of choice here was not political, it was natural being the fact that there can not exist 2 IG and for the fact that the leader Sako was appointed by I.P Sisyku Ayuke Tabe , the IG is still under the control of  I.P Sisyku Ayuke Tabe, if not Sako Ikom should have form a different IG with different document
<p>2.	Given the fact that the world, the press, social medias and even French Cameroon recognize the position of I.P Sisyku Ayuke Tabe as president his IG is there for legal and obtain the  status of LEGAL AUTHORITY
<p>3.	I.P Sisyku Ayuke Tabe is the face of the revolution, he also represents Ambazonia as well citizen and patriot of good will. He is voice for our children, relatives, mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters in jail
 <p>With the above views  I.P Sisyku Ayuke Tabe represent icon of IG and LEGAL AUTHORITY  </p>

<h2>2.	AGUREMENT AGAINST HOLDING A TIC AND BC</h2>
 <h3>i. The dangers of being caught with this document</h3>
<p>TIC may not be authorized by LRC (la Republic Du Cameroon) under the pretax of legality, forgetting they are not in their territory. Anyone caught any of this document risk being accuse of either being a terrorist, supporting terrorist or promoting disability in LRC, consequences can be so cruel, barbaric and primitive is one is not lucky enough.</p>
<p>It is never certain is must people in such case well rich their destination save or not, dead or alive but many are victims of such events.</p>
 <h3>ii. The risk of piracy</h3>
<p>Since consideration for easy and available service to the lowest point and to anybody, we can’t guarantee the services to be the best so far in terms of security, sabotaging, critics etc it but normal that others make false TCI and BC even LRC can be seen with these document because there is little or no security to crosscheck who demand or fabricate a document from where, and with what reason. With this it makes issues more complicated and uncertain what it can generate into if measures not taken </p>    
<h4> ii. The promotion of hatred and division among parties</h4>
<p>Generate hatred and division to a certain level where others don’t want the presence or welcome the lead and position of others, we can’t escape from it. LRC do take advantage of such occasion to exploit the stupidity to talk rubbish and make others believe on something that doesn’t exist at all. Whatever the case we most move on</p>
 <h4>iii. Conspiracy tool  </h4>
<p>If at one point those known as black legs decide to Sartell scores by accusing and conspiring the downfall of their friend , relative or any other person to be arrested by LRC, factors can takes this case serious given that we are living with so many LRC spy as well as family so close to us. </p>



<h2>3.	AGUREMENT ADVANCE FOR OPTAINING TIC AND BC</h2>
<h4>I.	National pride</h4>
<p>It is very Important to  be a proud citizen of your country, it is for the same reason that citizenship is admired were comparison for impressive development are differentiated, proud citizen are like teachers, they teach the world of what they don’t know or what they know but don’t appreciate it importance to the outside world</p>

<h4> ii. Identification</h4>
<p>Identifying yourself is a status that defined not just the physical aspect of an individual but also the moral, reputation, historic; biologic preview of what others see or expect from your, We ambazonians and in patriotic Ambazonians are  not Lazy people; we are honest, loving, caring, morally upright, honest, truthful and justice makers. It is left on to you as individual to continue the expression and believe on us to justify it course; we are Unique, we are Ambazonians of formal British Southern Cameroon</p>

 <h4>iii. Construction of patriotism and a strong sense of belonging </h4>
<p>Ambazonia since 1st October 2016 will never be the same again, that day remains memorable in history and in centuries to come, we have with us the birth of a new flag, 13county under the federal system, a national anthem, An Interim president Sisyku Ayuke Tabe, (Comander In Chief )  CIC Dr Cho Ayaba Locas and a hand full of supporters call activist. We fight a just course and are stand behind just leaders, I am proud of my leaders, we are proud of their effort, note that not all calling themselves Ambazonians are Patriot of Ambazonia , Must of them are patriot of LRC. Stand Behind true leaders and stop being distracted and used by agents of darkness call LRC </p>


<h4> vi. Global and National publicity as well education on the existence of Ambazonia</h4>
<p>We are globally notice, globally present not only during demonstration, public matching, and friendly organization but we are socially present in press, social media, magazine etc but all this is not enough because we all did this for a reason and the reason is to be realized so we have to double are effort, our sacrifice and our, time alongside others. Justice and peace are expensive to bay but we are ready to cross oceans and seas as well as miles of land to bring it back home for a new nation Ambazonia.
<p>Where ever you are be proud to present you identity to the world not just in symbols but also in document, we encourage every true citizen out there to make Ambazonia proud of their child, obtain your TIC or ATIC and your BC where ever you are with a unique and similar appearance in a few minute, come one come all.  

                              <h4> v. Promotion of Revolutionary spirit</h4>
<p>The revolutionary spirit is found in GZ ground zero, our fighters or defense unite are the engine of this revolution, whatever we do, what we say let fighters obtain and deserve the majority decision or last say, they don’t only stimulate the hope, but also sacrifice daily for the course and wellbeing of citizens in GZ . We have encourage unity, provide for them, protect them and have confidence in what they do. In that same light the United Contender Force is a first step toward Unity among forces in GZ. Let us not promote division, it is our fight whoever is  fighting or leading can only keep a legacy when we reach BUEA, and since no one can reach Buea alone we then forbid infighting, your independence is my independence so why fight independence again?</p>
<h4>I.	Unite every citizenship toward one course and objectivity</h4>
<p>If unity a song then Ambazonia will have 8million + musicians, on the other hand if hypocrite</p>
<p>Where sold in the market as slave 8million + Ambazonians should be working now in European plantations as slaves. What is unity in a revolution context, following people? , teaming up for propaganda? , Worshiping individuals? , none of this is Unity, You don’t need to like or dislike someone to unite with him, all that count is his destination and vision to solve a particular problem, it is natural that people hate others for no reason , is also normal that people convince others to hate others by lying against them. </p>
<p>If at this millennium ages of time you still listening and believing to what people say without investigating to see   yourself then you are not only lazy but am afraid stupid. So stop being stupid and be realistic, be a rational thinker, a visionary etc we have suffered this long because others think they are more citizens than others and I say no, we are the same , whatever your differences put Ambazonia first, Rally behind visionary leaders and this revolution well succeed in no distance time. Long leave Ambazonia patriot.</p>

   <h4> vi. Empower those leaders facing the right direction and encourage others to do same</h4>
<p>Our leaders are people who work exceptionally very hard when we give them enough reason to lead us.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately not anybody can be a leader, not every leader is loved, I still take the case of our IP Sisyku Ayuke Tabe, He did enough before arrested and now is still doing it, </p>
<p>good leaders can still be of good conduct even in hell fire, say what Yaounde is fooling the world to believe about IP Sisyku he remains whom he is and so shall it be.</p>
 <p>Impeach him hundred times it changes nothing about IP sisyku when one is trusted and he is hard working we expect repression from opening,</p>
 <p>Sisyku did not ask LRC to imprison him, he was kidnapped during the process of finding solution to this revolution, </p>
 <p>And am left with one question “Is this how it is going to end, that we just forget about leaders in jail even thought they were jailed for our sec,</p>
 <p>is this the new Ambazonia life style?”  He is not the First to be jail as leader while his dignity,</p>
 <p>personality and position still respected, at list he is not dead. This explain why it is very difficult to have a true leaders now,</p>
 <p>must of the leaders of other parties, shy away or careless about the tomorrow of Ambazonia because they have learn from the bad behavior of Ambazonias and some individual calling themselves leaders.</p> 
 <p>It is not logic that you Scarifies everything, thinking you are working for the peoples good or interest and tomorrow, 
 <p>and when you face a problem or jail for the same reason they just turn their back on you, it is not fair,</p>
<p> this doesn’t reflect us as Ambazonians. When you see other leaders pass their time stilling is because they don’t find reasons to use that money the proper way.</p>
 <p>Please we should wake up and stand strong behind our IP and CIC</p>

	<h2>4. Dominate the colonialism as well as Assimilation</h2>
<p>One of the principal reason for making ATIC or TIC and BC is because we have to start thinking like Ambazonians not Assimilated Cameroonians. Leaving LRC to obtain a different unique identity with a well-defined sovereignty will not be easy so it is a necessity that we start differentiating ourselves before we arrive the final destination as FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF AMBAZONIA. We should believe in our country, the future of our generation depends on it.</p>

  <h3>i. Conclusion base on 2 element and from a personal point of view</h3>
<h2>Conclusion base on long term</h4>
<p>If one were to make a report, then AMBAZONIA is a free nation, a nation of hope and effort to make this happen, all ambalanders must join hand now, to correct what I always describe as a HISTORICAL MISTAKE, French neocolonialism through LRC, is making it turn bake, we have what it takes to constitute an independent Ambazonai, there is no turning back because back is more worse than just fighting a war. So why return to meat another war waiting for you. The only way forward is to keep moving forward.</p> 

   <h2>5. Conclusion base on experience</h2>
 <p>In my opinion LRC will never allow us go in free because they have much to lose, and we will never feel comfortable leaving with them because they will never stop marginalizing us or look at us as second class citizens . Destiney have it plan for mankind and this time Destiney demand for a new country. The loss and damages we acquire will turn into joy, we are solving this problem once and for all, we don’t want to ever hear of Anglophone crisis again, Anglophones should not suffer another genocidal/ racism in years to come again. Enough is enough.</p>

<p> 1.	Advice on basic negligent that matters  </p>  
<p> 1.	Anyone in the position of an ATIC or TIC and BC should not dispose it carelessly.</p>
<p> 2.	TIC and BC should be fabricated in trust places or areas because of untrusted agent around us.</p>
<p> 3.	The size of the TIC or BC is 540 x 340 pixel; any other sizes are not welcome</p>
<p> 4.	We can create TIC and save it or download it to our external saving devices like USB, SD cards; external hard drive etc to print else were which is safe and secured as compared to caring it with physically.</p>
<p> 5.	BC is printed in an A4 page </p>
 <p>6.	Android phones can also be used for creating BC and TIC stored and printed whenever you want  or upload it on Google drive or in any other social saving software for future use</p>
 <p>7.	In the days ahead we might face difficulties traveling if you can’t present your TIC to any Defense Unite in control</p>
<p> 8.	As conclusion love your country by being in position of all citizenship Document TIC and BC</p><br><br><br>
